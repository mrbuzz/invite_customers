# Technical Choices 
- Command line app
- Language of choice is Rust
  as it is particularly suited for building command line apps and it is usually my language of choice for such projects. 

# Assumptions
- Earth radius in kilometers: `6371.0`
- floats are rounded with the `ceiling` function
# Installation
You just need to install the Rust development environment. It is cross-paltform so it can be installed pretty much everywere:
- If youâ€™re running macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS you can just run the following:
  `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- If you are using Windows see [other installation methods](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html)

# Building
- `cargo build` to build a non optimized version with debuginfo 
- `cargo build --release` to build a release version

# Running Tests 
- `cargo test`  runs the entire test suite 

# How to run
The app can be executed through `cargo` or manually calling the compiled executable from the `target` folder

- `cargo run -- /path/to/imput/file.txt`
- `target/release/invite_customers /path/to/imput/file.txt`

An optional output file can be specified,if nothing is specified it defaults to `stdout`
- `cargo run -- /path/to/imput/file.txt -o output.txt`
- `cargo run -- /path/to/imput/file.txt --output output.txt`

An optional km range can be specified, default is 100 Km
- `cargo run -- /path/to/imput/file.txt -r 25`
- `cargo run -- /path/to/imput/file.txt --range 25`
```bash
